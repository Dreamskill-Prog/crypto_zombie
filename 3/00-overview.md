Grr... I just can't slow you down, can I? Your Solidity skills are formidable, human...

Now that you've got some experience coding Solidity under your belt, we're going to dive into some of the more technical aspects of Ethereum development. 

This lesson will be a bit less flashy (sorry, no plot twists!). But you’ll learn some really important concepts that will take you closer to building real DApps — things like **gas costs, code optimization, and contract ownership**.

You've been warned — no kitties and rainbows in Lesson 3! We highly recommend you complete lesson 2 before continuing.
