You're learning so much more about solidity by learning about oracles! You got it. Since we defined `returns (bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory performData)`, this defined the variable `upkeepNeeded` as type `bool` and told solidity "Hey, if you see a variable named `upkeepNeeded`, that's one of the variables you're going to return."

You'll notice, we didn't have to define `performData`. That's because it's optional, solidity auto-set the variable to the null version of bytes when we declared it in the function, `0x0`. So it will still return the 2 variables `(bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory performData)` but, `performData` will just be 0 bytes object. 

This `checkUpkeep` will return `true` every time 60 seconds has past the last time stamp! Perfect! And will trigger the Chainlink Keepers to do some action on our smart contract, which in our case, is updating the counter and updating the 

So now... let's code the actions.


## Putting it to the test

1. Create a function `performUpkeep` that overrides the interface's `performUpkeep` function.

2. Up the `counter` by 1.

3. Change the `lastTimeStamp` to the current timestamp.
