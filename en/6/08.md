You got it! The VRF Consumerbase includes all the code we need to send a request to a Chainlink oracle, including all the event logging code. 

Now, as we said, to interact with a Chainlink node, we need to know a few variables. 

- The Chainlink token contract address
  - This is needed so our contract can tell if we have enough LINK to pay our oracle gas.
- The VRF coordinator contract address
  - So we can verify the number we are returned is actually random. 
- The Chainlink node keyhash
  - To identify which Chainlink node we want to work with.
- The Chainlink node fee
  - How much this Chainlink node costs in LINK gas. 


You can find all these variables in the [Chainlink VRF Contract addresses documentation page.](https://docs.chain.link/docs/vrf-contracts/) Once again, the addresses will be different across networks, we will again be working with the rinkeby network. 

But how do we tell our contract what to do with these variables? Well, let's first take a look at the VRFConsumerbase constructor.

```javascript
constructor(address _vrfCoordinator, address _link) public {
    vrfCoordinator = _vrfCoordinator;
    LINK = LinkTokenInterface(_link);
  }
```

As said in the last lesson, we are going to inherit the functionality of this VRFConsumerbase. But how do we implement a constructor of an inherited contract? And the answer is that we can have a constructor in a constructor. 

Let's take a look at this sample code:

```javascript
import "./Y.sol";
contract X is Y {
    constructor() Y() public{
    }
}
```

To use a constructor of an inherited contract, we just put the constructor declaration as apart of our contracts constructor. 

We can do the same thing with our VRFConsumerbase with something like:

```javascript
constructor() VRFConsumerBase(
    0xb3dCcb4Cf7a26f6cf6B120Cf5A73875B7BBc655B, // VRF Coordinator
    0x01BE23585060835E02B77ef475b0Cc51aA1e0709  // LINK Token
) public{
    
}   
```

## Putting it to the test

1. Have our `ZombieFactory` contract inherit our VRFConsumerbase contract.

2. Create a constructor for our `ZombieFactory` that also includes the `VRFConsumerBase` with addresses of the [VRF Coordinator and LINK token from the rinkeby network.](https://docs.chain.link/docs/vrf-contracts/#rinkeby)
