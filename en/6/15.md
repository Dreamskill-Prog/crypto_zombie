Great, now we need to create our `checkUpkeep` function.

We want the Chainlink Keepers to see if the last timestamp plus our interval is more than the current timestamp. Meaning, we want it to see if 60 seconds has past!

Remember, it must match the interface we imported. And since we want this to be the real method people use and not the interface's (unfinished) method, we have to give it the `override` keyword in the function declaration.

## Putting it to the test

1. Create the `checkUpkeep` function that returns `upkeepNeeded`, a `bool` that says whether or not 60 seconds has past.

> Note: The `returns` of our function should also match the interface. If we define the type and name of our variable in the returns section of function declaration, we actually don't have to have a return statement. Feel free to use hints to see what this means.
