Our Solidity contract for lesson 2 is complete! 

When we were ready to deploy this contract to Ethereum, we would just compile and deploy `ZombieFeeding` — since this contract is our final contract that inherits from `ZombieFactory, and has access to the final methods we need.

## Interacting with our contract

Let's look at an example javascript implementation of how we would interact with our contract.

```
var abi = /* abi generated by the compiler */
var ZombieFeedingContract = web3.eth.contract(abi)
var contractAddress = /* our contract address on Ethereum after deploying */
var ZombieFeeding = ZombieFeedingContract.at(contractAddress)

let zombieId = 1
let kittyId = 1;

// To get the CryptoKitty's image, we need to query their web API. This
// information isn't stored on the blockchain, just their webserver.
let apiUrl = "https://api.cryptokitties.co/kitties/" + kittyId
$.get(apiUrl, function(data) {
  let imgUrl = data.image_url
})

// TODO — some javascript implementation here

function feedOnKitty(zombieId, kittyId) {
  ZombieFeeding.feedOnKitty(zombieId, kittyId)
}
```

# Give it a try!

Select a zombie to the right by clicking on it. Then select the kitty you want to feed on.

Their DNA will combine, and you'll get a new zombie in your army!

Have your zombies feed on all the remaining kitties, then proceed to the next chapter to complete lesson 2.
